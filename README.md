## Some statistics on the 2015 Super Rugby thus far

If you take a look at
[the 2015 Super Rugby table](http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/super-rugby/ladder),
it's immediately clear that NZ teams are doing extremely well.

I was interested to see how teams in each of the three groups are doing
against teams from other groups. For example, the Australian teams are
doing OK, but might it be that they are mainly good at beating each other
or are they winning well across the board?

Two interesting things come from the results (below):

1. Although all groups have played roughly the same number of matches (AUS
   61, NZ 61, RSA 62), the number played against teams from other groups is
   not as evenly balanced (AUS 29, NZ 35, RSA 32).

1. NZ teams have won 36/61 (59%) of their games overall. But if you look at
   their record in out-of-group games, the percentage goes up: they've won
   29/35 (65.7%). In contrast, Australian teams have won 26/61 (42.6%) of
   their games overall, but out-of-group have won just 10/29 (34.5%).

The conclusion of all this?

Relative to other countries, the Australian teams are doing worse than it
might first appear (i.e., they're doing a good job of beating each other).
Meanwhile, the NZ teams are doing even better at beating everyone else than
it might first appear from their overall record. The South African teams
are doing about as well at beating each other as they are at beating
others.
